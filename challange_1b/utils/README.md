# Challenge 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Approach Explanation

### Overview

Our solution implements a sophisticated persona-driven document intelligence system that processes multiple PDF collections and extracts the most relevant content based on specific user personas and their job-to-be-done requirements. The system handles three distinct collections: Travel Planning, Adobe Acrobat Learning, and Recipe Collections.

### Core Architecture

#### 1. PDF Processing Pipeline (PDFProcessor)

The foundation of our system provides robust document analysis:

- **Multi-format Text Extraction**: Uses PyMuPDF for comprehensive PDF text extraction with page-level granularity
- **Intelligent Section Detection**: Implements pattern-based header recognition using regex patterns for titles, numbered sections, and structural elements
- **Content Quality Assessment**: Filters and validates extracted sections based on length, coherence, and structural integrity
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure management for corrupted or inaccessible PDF files

#### 2. Persona Analysis Engine (PersonaAnalyzer)

The core intelligence component that understands user context:

- **Dynamic Persona Classification**: Automatically identifies persona types (Travel Planner, HR Professional, Food Contractor) from role descriptions
- **Domain-Specific Keyword Matching**: Maintains specialized vocabularies for each persona category
- **Job Context Integration**: Analyzes job-to-be-done descriptions to enhance relevance scoring
- **Weighted Scoring Algorithm**: Combines persona-specific and task-specific relevance with configurable weights (60% persona, 40% task)

#### 3. Content Relevance Scoring

Advanced algorithmic approach for content prioritization:

- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Evaluates content against both persona keywords and job-specific terminology
- **Frequency-based Scoring**: Calculates keyword density while normalizing for content length
- **Amplified Differentiation**: Uses scoring amplification (15x multiplier) to create clear relevance distinctions
- **Bounded Output**: Caps relevance scores at 1.0 for consistent comparison

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Collection Processing Workflow

1. **Input Configuration Loading**: Parses `challenge1b_input.json` files for each collection
2. **Document Iteration**: Processes all PDFs in collection-specific directories
3. **Section Extraction**: Applies persona-aware analysis to each document section
4. **Relevance Ranking**: Sorts content by calculated relevance scores
5. **Output Generation**: Creates structured JSON with top 15 most relevant sections

#### Performance Optimizations

- **Streaming Processing**: Handles large document collections without memory overflow
- **Content Length Limiting**: Truncates section content to 1000 characters for output efficiency
- **Early Filtering**: Removes low-quality sections before expensive scoring operations
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes all three collections in sequence

### Persona-Specific Adaptations

#### Travel Planner Persona

- **Keywords**: destination, itinerary, accommodation, restaurant, attraction, activity, budget, transportation, booking, schedule, group, hotel, tourism, sightseeing, culture, history, local, france, travel, trip, vacation, guide, tourist, city, cuisine
- **Focus Areas**: Group planning, budget considerations, local experiences, cultural insights

#### HR Professional Persona

- **Keywords**: form, document, compliance, onboarding, employee, policy, signature, workflow, process, digital, fillable, field, data, collection, management, automation, electronic, acrobat, pdf, create, convert, edit, export, fill, sign
- **Focus Areas**: Digital workflows, form creation, compliance management, automation

#### Food Contractor Persona

- **Keywords**: recipe, ingredient, cooking, preparation, menu, dish, vegetarian, buffet, serving, nutrition, meal, kitchen, catering, corporate, dinner, food, cuisine, dietary, breakfast, lunch, restaurant, chef, cooking
- **Focus Areas**: Menu planning, dietary restrictions, corporate catering, buffet-style serving

### Innovation Highlights

- **Context-Aware Processing**: Adapts analysis approach based on document collection characteristics
- **Multi-Collection Intelligence**: Handles diverse document types with tailored processing strategies
- **Scalable Architecture**: CPU-only design suitable for production deployment
- **Comprehensive Output**: Provides detailed metadata, processing statistics, and analytical insights

### Quality Assurance

- **Schema Compliance**: Strict adherence to required JSON output format
- **Error Recovery**: Robust handling of missing files and processing failures
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed logging and processing statistics
- **Validation Framework**: Built-in checks for output quality and completeness
- **Intelligent Diversification**: Balances relevance with content variety
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles diverse domains and persona types without manual configuration

This approach ensures high-quality, persona-specific content extraction while maintaining performance constraints and schema compliance requirements.

## üöÄ How to Run

### Method 1: Python Direct Execution

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd challange_1b

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the processor
python pdf_process.py
```

### Method 2: Docker Container (Recommended)

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t pdf-analysis:1 .

# Run with volume mounting (for file access)
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/app" --network none pdf-analysis:1

# For Windows PowerShell:
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/app" --network none pdf-analysis:1
```

  --network none \
  pdf-analysis:1
```

---

## üìä Processing Results

After successful execution, you'll see:

```
Processing Collection 1
Output written to Collection 1/challenge1b_output.json

Processing Collection 2  
Output written to Collection 2/challenge1b_output.json
